# Basic Fighting Game Guide: From Zero to Hero
New to Fighting Games?
TECH/GUIDE

Before you read a single sentence in this article, LOOK AT YOUR NUMPAD. LOOK AT IT! SEE THE LITTLE ARROWS ON THE 2, 4, 8, AND 6...guess what the number 6 refers to in relation to a fighting game. This is called numpad notation, and while I don't use it in this article it is crucial you know this information. Numpad notation always refers to your character on the left side facing right, so the number 4 always means back, or away, from the opponent. The opposite is true for the 6, pretty easy once you learn it. Now lets get into


## The Basics

Most fighting game revolve around a very simple game of rock, paper, scissors that is far easier to understand than execute. *Attack, Block, Grab* is your *new rock, paper, scissors*. Blocking beats attacking, grabbing beats blocking, and attacking beats grabbing, generally. It's usually a good idea to know how to attack in fighting games which is what mission training and free training are for. 

As a rule of thumb you should always check out at least the basic mission training used for all characters. The specific training will help you later, but for now you need to develop some good fundamentals that can translate to any fighting game. It's also worth noting that these basic missions usually explain or introduce new mechanics that are game specific. You might miss out on some good tech by not exploring what the game is giving you for free. Once you're comfortable with the training information you need a way to practice which is where the free training, practice or whatever the game calls it comes into play. 

It's the mode where a character stands there and gets their teeth knocked in for hours. *This will let you learn the ranges of your attacks and where it's safe to use specific moves*. This is referred to as spacing in fighting games because...well its about the space between you and your opponent. The ability to manipulate the space between your opponent to gain an advantage is usually called `footsies`. I wouldn't focus so much on the phrasing of each technique or actions, these aren't vocab words and there's no quiz. 

I'm just trying to install some knowledge that will help everyone who joins a fighting game discussion down the road. Back to training modes...*Arcade mode*, despite seeming counter intuitive for training against real people, can help you learn how to use moves and mechanics in an *almost real scenario*. 

Focus on `spacing` and `poking` with your attacks if you go this route. It trains you to anticipate where the enemy will be *when you start an attack vs where they are when the hit lands*. As another rule of thumb for using arcade mode to practice, try not to jump. It's gonna be hard because it's so fun to jump in and blow your opponent up, but I guarantee you...that is an awful habit to pick up and you will be mercilessly punished for it. Think of a jump as another attack, used randomly an attack could be counter hit or avoided completely, the same mechanic applies to jumping. 

Arcade mode also familiarizes you with each character and their specific move set, which is important to improve. Every character in a fighting game has a specific strategy they are trying to force onto the match. The struggle between the two characters strategy is what makes fighting games so fun, and one of the most varied game types. Knowing what your opponent wants to do, makes it easier to counter. And knowing how they can counter you, makes it easier to force your strategy onto them. So it's generally a good idea to investigate each character while training. 

Once you feel comfortable with your move set and what your strategy in game will be, there's only one thing left to do...practice. The goal is to feel like the character is an extension of yourself. The same way you don't have to look at your hand to know what it can do and how to do it. You want to be able to feel your character, their strengths and weaknesses should feel like your strengths and weaknesses. I mean technically they are already, but you need to know instinctively how to bolster these strengths, and diminish these weaknesses. And in order to fully understand that statement you need to know about the `three game state`.

Neutral refers to the game state that occurs at the start of the round. Both characters doing nothing, staring at each other menacingly. In neutral you'll generally see a lot of *`whiffed` attacks for the purpose of range finding and to pester the opponents approach*. If your character has a fireball, neutral is the place to throw it out. `Footsies` plays its most important role here. You should be trying to *move into and out of each others ranges in a confusing pattern, poking them when they miss an attack and retreating when you miss*. This is also where learning all your attacks ranges come into play. The game will usually flow in and out neutral naturally so its a very good idea to recognize where your neutral 'sweet spot' is. Knowing when to use each attack based on spacing will see you winning the neutral game, which leads to... `Offense` & `Defense`

</td>

<tr>
<td><code>Offense</code></td>
<td>

So you've won the neutral game and have a chance to push the advantage. But you need to safely mount an offense based on your characters strengths and weaknesses. For example, let's say your character has an extremely damaging move that leaves you very vulnerable if you miss. You're goal 100% should be to land this powerful move, but throwing it out just to see if it hits is too dangerous. *Think of offense like a checklist*, with the first step being "win neutral" and the last step being "land powerful move". The only step left is whats referred to as "opening up" your opponent. There are a variety of ways to do this, but the most basic is the high/low `mix up`. Most characters have an overhead attack, which if guarded low will extended over the characters head and bypass their guard. But if they are standing to block the overhead, attacking low slips under their guard. It's important to know what you can do after each of these options, so I suggest entering training mode to practice both. You could also jump at your opponent which, like we talked about, is a high risk, high reward option. A jumping attack will also hit overhead, but it's far easier to see it coming. The last option would be to grab your opponent. Most games have a forward and back throw option. Generally you want to throw your opponent closer to the corner so they have less options on defense. Even if it's just "hey I can't walk backwards anymore", that's still one less variable you as the attacker have to deal with. Throws and sweeps, if the game your playing has a sweep, lead to a hard knockdown. This results in something called `Okizeme`, or wake-up. Most of the time shortened to `Oki`, this is when you have some of the most potential as an attacker. This is also one of the only times jumping can't be countered, and it plays an essential part of Oki game play. 
So let's run down some `Oki options`:

>- You can throw out whats called a `'meaty' attack`. This is an attack that, when timed properly, forces your opponent into a block as soon as they recover from standing. It basically resets the position you were in prior to the knockdown. They could also decide not to block...free damage.

>- *Jumping in creates a natural 50/50 guessing game* that in most cases could be punished, but because your opponent is locked into the get up animation they can't. The goal is to make your opponent guess *which side your attack will hit from*. What you need to know to do this is your character's *ambiguous jumping attacks*. These are attacks that hit in *visually deceiving ways*, and that are difficult to quickly assess which side they are going to land. This is usually a very rewarding option, because if guessed wrong, they will be holding into your attack instead of blocking. If the game you're playing has a block button...RIP this option.

>- `Empty jumps` are exactly what they sound like, and is just another option that makes ambiguous setups more dangerous. This option usually lands more quickly than attacking options, which you can use to start another mix up, throw, sweep etc. Note that if your opponent is always doing something when they wake up, attacking or whatever, this is not a good option because it will leave an opening for the opponent to return to neutral.

>- **Walk up** and **throw** them. It may seem stupid, but after having to block meaty attacks, guess on ambiguous jumps, crouch block sweeps, and deal with the mounting pressure of solid defense...sometimes people just don't expect you to abandon all your options, walk right up to them, and **grab** them.

I want to lastly throw out a side not for `zoning characters`, or characters that rely primarily on **projectiles**. Your offense is going to look a lot like neutral, so it is very beneficial to learn how close a character can get to you before it is unsafe to throw a projectile. Some `zoners` have the ability to start close pressure, but the main focus should be to snipe your opponent over and over with your projectiles. By doing this you are frustrating them, and making them consider more options for approach. When they begin to approach in an unsafe manner, punish them with whatever tools you have available and return to pew-pewing. Zoners ability to do this effectively is based on the speed of the game. The faster the game is, the harder it is usually to zone characters out. Imagine firing a roman candle at a golf cart, versus firing at a motorcycle. Chances are you will be able to chip away at the golf cart a lot more before it gets to you. And when some does get to you every character will need to know...

<td><code>Defense</code></td>
<td>

Defense is hard. It's hard not to get hit when the opponent knows your character as well as you do. It's tough to not want to hit buttons and start your own combo because that's why you learned them. Not every move can be countered, and if it can, sometimes you shouldn't. That's more game specific but I'm trying to get a point across to you, the reader, the new player that wants to learn how to play or whatever reason you're reading this. *Just. Wait. When the opponent is attacking*, they are in the driver seat. If you try to grab the wheel you're going to get hit. This is called waiting your turn, and it may seem stupid at first, but you'll notice that after doing it for a little while...somehow their turns aren't doing any damage. You have the power, to sit and take no action. Do nothing. Let them exhaust their resources. Let them make you guess some. Eventually there will be an opening, maybe small, sometimes massive, where you can seize the turn and pay back all that time you had to spend blocking. This section is going to be about recognizing those openings, and about easy ways to defend yourself against the mix ups mentioned in the previous section. So let's dive in.

You know your *opponent's special moves and combos*, you know that they have a little checklist of their own. So if you prepared for the match using training mode like suggested, you will have a pretty good idea of where you need to be to avoid your opponents pokes. But uh-oh, wrong input, simple mistake, now your opponent is in your face about to poke you in the eyes. What are your options against their `options`:

>- The 50/50. Against high/low mix ups its generally a good idea to **crouch block**. Most high attacks will be blocked both standing and crouching, and obviously low attacks will be blocked. In the event someone throws out an overhead, it's usually easier to let go of a button on reaction than to press one. If your game has a record feature in the training mode you can just randomly smash button attacks while alternating crouching and standing so you won't know what the training dummy is going to do next. It will be good practice.

>- The jump-in. When I mentioned jumping as high risk high reward, I hope it will be high risk because of the people reading this. Your goal for this defense, is to go into training mode, *find the attack that hits as high and as far away from your body while crouching, and standing*. Those two moves are whats called `anti-air moves`. The main thing you want to focus on when using `anti-air` is to shrink your `hit box`, or the areas that can be hit by opponents. Crouching shrinks you by about 1/3 most of the time, which is exactly what you want. And the actual anti-air attack should hit somewhere right above and in front of your head. Think of a jump as a pyramid, they are attempting to ride that side of the pyramid down and into you. You're using a proactive strategy that prevents them from getting anywhere close to you by blocking their only angle of approach with a fist, or foot, etc.

>- Grabs...there really isn't much to say about this one. You could walk back to avoid the grab, jump, attack...but this one comes down to reactions. Sorry to everyone that wanted a full proof guide for basics, but when it comes to grabs, practice really does make, well, OK. Sometimes grabs are hard to see, they may even be disguised in the ending of a move or cancelled into from the start of another. There is no, "HE WILL GRAB HERE" formula, and it mostly comes down to who you're playing. Some people just don't do it, others love it...but we all hate getting grabbed because it forces you into...

   `Okizeme Defense`. Easily one of the hardest things to learn in any fighting game, okizeme defense is sometimes referred to as 'The Vortex'. It feels like you're literally fighting a tornado. Will he attack from the right, the left, sweep me, grab me, bop me, twist me, pull me...it's overwhelming sometimes. So here's a list of your `options` on defense against the ones I mentioned above

>- Against `meaty attacks` you have really only two options. You can block the attack, or if your character has an invincible move, do it ON FRAME ONE of your get up. It is extremely important to note that you have to do it ON FRAME ONE because the meaty was thrown out specifically to stop you from moving. So if you lag behind it even slightly, your invincible move to get away won't happen, and you'll be left holding your teeth.

>- Jump ins. Because the existence of jump ins is to create a left/right mix-up you know that they can always be blocked standing, which is a good starting point. Also, if you notice your opponent jumped too late after the hard knockdown, it's possible to just anti-air the cross-up. The timing for this may be more or less strict depending on the speed of your game and the jumps within. If your character has an invincible move, it may be better to just let it rip than sit and guess on the block. It's important to note that you should make certain the opponent does an attack before throwing out your invincible move, because he probably knows you have it as well, and might be using the jump as bait. If you've played the game enough, your eye for where their jump is going should be pretty good. Use this to your advantage if you want to block the 50/50. As a tip for doing this, hold block in the normal direction until as late as possible, if they haven't attacked by the time their body is directly over you, immediately switch block sides. Note that I mean to do this from the moment they jump, even as your character is standing. This seems easy to do just from a description, but you won't really get the feel for it until you do it in-game.

>- Reading `empty jumps` takes some practice, but you will usually be able to recognize when it is happening if you know the timing of your opponents air moves. You won't truly know for certain until the jump is about 3/4 of the way through the air. Most air moves still have start up frames, so the chances they would even be able to use one decrease very rapidly the closer they get to the ground. Most empty jumps are used as either bait for a whiffed attack, or to immediately use a low attack and catch you trying to block the overhead. Something you may consider on a late empty jump, when your opponent is landing too late and you have a moment to move, is to neutral jump. Jump straight into the air and come down with a fast attack of your own. This is one of the more risky options, as an anti-air from the opponent will catch you. But if you've been playing patiently most of the game, they might not expect this aggression.

>- Grabs...not really sure what to say about grabs I haven't said previously. I'll just reiterate that this is going to be based on your reactions.

A Message to Players

Some things can't be taught, but I can prepare you for the inevitable. You are going to lose. You're going to lose a lot, to people that are better than you. You will lose to people who cheese you out, and you will lose close sets you feel like you should have won. I strongly advise you replay these sets in your head over and over. Not to blame yourself for a shoddy performance, or to remember how dumb the opponents strat was. Just replay them and imagine different options for every second of the match. This is going to help you practice in the long run. Just because an option worked this time doesn't mean it will work every time. Self critique is essential for growth, and being humble is the road to better play. Never discard or ignore information given to you, even if the player is newer to the scene than you are. And be fucking polite for fucks sake, the way people act sometimes is ridiculous. This community grew because people were open to new ideas and new players, follow in the example set, it's a good one. And finally...to end it all. I mean my last point not me, my life, whatever. Lag sucks, latency will fuck you, the anonymous players will troll you, and god forbid you run into a pro in your first month. Sometimes the chips don't fall in our favor, but you can't give up. I've given you a plethora of information and some tips to get you started. So please, if not for yourself, for me...see yourself improve. Show me that your time wasn't wasted. Win.
